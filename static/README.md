# Static Directory

This folder contains static assets such as images, fonts, and other files served directly by the application.

- Organize assets into subfolders by type (e.g., `images/`, `fonts/`).
- Only include files required for the application's operation or UI.
- Document any conventions for asset naming and usage here.
