# System Cleanup Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive audit of the system was conducted to identify and remove unused files, particularly in the scripts directory.

## Audit Results

### Scripts Directory Cleanup
- **Total files before cleanup**: 60 Python files
- **Files deleted**: 54 files
- **Files remaining**: 6 Python files + 3 log files + 3 README files + 1 JSON file

### Deleted Files by Category

#### Test Files (20 files)
- All files starting with `test_` were removed
- These were one-time testing scripts for various APIs and functionality
- Examples: `test_all_apis.py`, `test_darts_api.py`, `test_golf.py`, etc.

#### Download Files (14 files)
- All files starting with `download_` were removed
- These were one-time scripts for downloading player photos and data
- Examples: `download_golf_player_photos.py`, `download_lpga_player_photos.py`, etc.

#### Debug Files (5 files)
- All files starting with `debug_` were removed
- These were temporary debugging scripts
- Examples: `debug_golf.py`, `debug_rapidapi.py`, etc.

#### Other Unused Files (15 files)
- Various utility scripts that were no longer needed
- Examples: `add_missing_columns.py`, `migrate_player_props.py`, etc.

### Remaining Files

#### Active Python Scripts (6 files)
1. **multi_sport_data_recorder.py** - Active data recording utility
2. **tennis_data_recorder.py** - Tennis-specific data recording
3. **save_datagolf_players_dict.py** - Golf player data utility
4. **optimize_database.py** - Database optimization utility
5. **update_player_search_cache.py** - Player search cache utility
6. **fetch_single_league.py** - League data fetching utility

#### Log Files (3 files)
- `multi_provider_test.log` - Test log file
- `league_discovery.log` - League discovery log
- `discovered_leagues.json` - League discovery data

#### Documentation Files (3 files)
- `README_PLAYER_DATA.md` - Player data documentation
- `README_player_images.md` - Player images documentation
- `README_FIFA_WORLD_CUP.md` - FIFA World Cup documentation

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Repository Size**: Removed 54 unused files
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find relevant scripts
3. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed clutter and outdated code
4. **Better Organization**: Only active and necessary files remain

## Files Preserved

The remaining files are actively used by the system:
- Data recording utilities for ongoing operations
- Database optimization tools
- Player search and caching functionality
- League data fetching utilities
- Important documentation and logs

## Conclusion

The cleanup successfully removed 90% of the unused script files while preserving all actively used functionality. The system is now more organized and maintainable.
