# Transparency Mask Fixes Summary

## Problem
The bet slip images were showing logos with solid backgrounds instead of transparent backgrounds, making them look unprofessional and not matching the expected design.

## Root Cause
The previous fix was extracting the alpha channel and using it as a mask, but this approach was not preserving transparency correctly. The proper approach is to use the RGBA image itself as the mask when it's in RGBA mode.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `bot/utils/game_line_image_generator.py`
- **League Logo Paste Operation** (line ~339): Updated to use RGBA image as mask
- **Team Logo Paste Operations** (lines ~451, ~457, etc.): Updated all team logo paste operations
- **Lock Icon Paste Operations** (lines ~574, ~584): Updated lock icon paste operations
- **Default/Sport-specific Logo Operations**: Updated all special handling sections

### 2. `bot/utils/player_prop_image_generator.py`
- **League Logo Paste Operation** (line ~303): Updated to use RGBA image as mask
- **Team Logo Paste Operation** (line ~327): Updated team logo paste operation
- **Player Image Paste Operation** (line ~338): Updated player image paste operation
- **Lock Icon Paste Operations** (lines ~447, ~457): Updated lock icon paste operations

### 3. `bot/utils/parlay_bet_image_generator.py`
- **Team/Opponent/Player/Fallback Logo Paste Operations** (lines ~218, ~238, ~272, ~293, ~300): Updated all logo paste operations
- **Lock Icon Paste Operations** (lines ~439, ~446): Updated lock icon paste operations

## Solution Applied
Changed from:
```python
# OLD APPROACH (incorrect)
if image.mode == 'RGBA':
    alpha = image.split()[-1]
    image.paste(logo, (x, y), alpha)
```

To:
```python
# NEW APPROACH (correct)
if image.mode == 'RGBA':
    image.paste(logo, (x, y), logo)
```

## Additional Improvements
- Ensured all images are converted to RGBA mode before pasting
- Added proper fallback handling for non-RGBA images
- Maintained consistent code pattern across all image generators

## Testing
The transparency fixes should now properly display:
- Team logos with transparent backgrounds
- League logos with transparent backgrounds
- Player images with transparent backgrounds
- Lock icons with transparent backgrounds
- All logos should blend seamlessly with the dark background

## Impact
- Professional appearance of bet slip images
- Consistent visual design across all bet types
- Proper transparency handling for all image elements
- No more solid background artifacts on logos
