# Production File Not Updated - Deployment Issue

## Current Status

**Date**: December 2024
**Issue**: Production still running old version of fetcher.py
**Evidence**: Logs show old import statement
**Status**: ⏳ **AWAITING PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

## Evidence from Production Logs

### **Old Import Statement Still Running**
```
File "/home/container/bot/utils/fetcher.py", line 8, in <module>
    from bot.config.leagues import LEAGUE_CONFIG, get_league_id, is_league_in_season
ImportError: cannot import name 'get_league_id' from 'bot.config.leagues'
```

### **What Should Be Running**
```
from bot.config.leagues import LEAGUE_CONFIG
```

## Comparison

### **Production (Current - Broken)**
```python
# Line 8 in production fetcher.py
from bot.config.leagues import LEAGUE_CONFIG, get_league_id, is_league_in_season
```

### **Local (Fixed - Working)**
```python
# Line 8 in local fetcher.py
from bot.config.leagues import LEAGUE_CONFIG
```

## Root Cause

The production environment is still running the **old version** of `bot/utils/fetcher.py` that contains the problematic import statement.

## Required Action

### **1. Deploy Updated File**
The production `bot/utils/fetcher.py` file needs to be updated with the latest version that includes:
- ✅ Fixed import statement (removed `get_league_id`, `is_league_in_season`)
- ✅ Added main execution block
- ✅ Proper database connection handling
- ✅ Complete fetching logic

### **2. Restart Production Bot**
After deploying the file, restart the production bot process to pick up the changes.

## Verification Steps

### **After Deployment, Check Logs For:**
```
✅ Starting fetcher process...
✅ Database connection pool created
✅ Fetching data for 4 leagues on 2024-12-19
✅ Fetched and cached raw data for NFL (football)
✅ Successfully normalized X games for NFL
✅ Fetcher process completed successfully
✅ Database connection pool closed
```

### **Instead of Current Error:**
```
❌ ImportError: cannot import name 'get_league_id' from 'bot.config.leagues'
❌ Fetcher process ended unexpectedly with return code 0
```

## Files That Need Deployment

1. **`bot/utils/fetcher.py`** - Main file with all fixes
2. **`bot/config/leagues.py`** - API_KEY loading fix (if not already deployed)

## Timeline

- **Issue Identified**: ✅ Complete
- **Local Fix Applied**: ✅ Complete
- **Production Deployment**: ⏳ **PENDING**
- **Verification**: ⏳ **PENDING**

## Conclusion

The fetcher issues have been completely resolved locally. The production environment simply needs to be updated with the latest version of the files. Once deployed, the fetcher should work perfectly.
