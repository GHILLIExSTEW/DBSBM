# Production Deployment Required - Fetcher Issues

## Current Production Status

**Date**: December 2024
**Issue**: Production environment running outdated code
**Impact**: Fetcher process crashes continuously

## Problems Identified

### **1. Wrong Fetcher Path**
- **Production Logs Show**: `/home/container/bot/fetcher.py` (file not found)
- **Correct Path Should Be**: `/home/container/bot/utils/fetcher.py`
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** in main.py (line 497)

### **2. Import Error in Fetcher**
- **Production Logs Show**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'get_league_id' from 'bot.config.leagues'`
- **Root Cause**: Fetcher trying to import non-existent functions
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** in bot/utils/fetcher.py (line 8)

## Required Deployment

### **Files That Need to Be Updated in Production**

1. **`bot/main.py`** - Already has correct fetcher path
2. **`bot/utils/fetcher.py`** - Fixed import statement

### **Specific Changes Made**

#### **bot/utils/fetcher.py**
```python
# Before (causing ImportError)
from bot.config.leagues import LEAGUE_CONFIG, get_league_id, is_league_in_season

# After (working correctly)
from bot.config.leagues import LEAGUE_CONFIG
```

#### **bot/main.py**
```python
# Already correct (line 497)
self.fetcher_process = subprocess.Popen(
    [sys.executable, os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "utils", "fetcher.py")],
    # ... rest of configuration
)
```

## Deployment Instructions

### **1. Update Production Code**
```bash
# Deploy the updated files to production
# - bot/utils/fetcher.py (fixed imports)
# - bot/main.py (already correct)
```

### **2. Restart Production Bot**
```bash
# Restart the bot process to pick up changes
# The fetcher should now start successfully
```

### **3. Verify Deployment**
Check production logs for:
- ✅ No more "No such file or directory" errors
- ✅ No more ImportError for get_league_id
- ✅ Fetcher process starts successfully
- ✅ Game data fetching begins

## Expected Results After Deployment

### **Before Deployment**
```
❌ /usr/bin/python3.9: can't open file '/home/container/bot/fetcher.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
❌ ImportError: cannot import name 'get_league_id' from 'bot.config.leagues'
❌ Fetcher process crashes every 5 seconds
❌ No game data being fetched
```

### **After Deployment**
```
✅ Started fetcher (fetcher.py) as subprocess with PID XXX
✅ Fetcher process running successfully
✅ Game data fetching working
✅ Bot has access to current game data
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] **Code Deployed**: Latest version of bot/utils/fetcher.py deployed
- [ ] **Bot Restarted**: Production bot process restarted
- [ ] **Path Fixed**: No more "No such file or directory" errors
- [ ] **Import Fixed**: No more ImportError for get_league_id
- [ ] **Fetcher Running**: Fetcher process starts and stays running
- [ ] **Data Fetching**: Game data begins to populate in database
- [ ] **Logs Clean**: No more fetcher-related errors in logs

## Technical Details

### **Files Modified**
1. **bot/utils/fetcher.py**
   - Line 8: Removed non-existent imports
   - Maintained LEAGUE_CONFIG import

### **No Changes Needed**
1. **bot/main.py** - Already has correct fetcher path
2. **bot/config/leagues.py** - No changes needed

### **Dependencies**
- All other imports in fetcher.py remain unchanged
- Database connections and API calls unaffected
- Bot functionality preserved

## Timeline

- **Issue Identified**: December 2024
- **Local Fix Applied**: ✅ Complete
- **Production Deployment**: ⏳ **PENDING**
- **Verification**: ⏳ **PENDING**

## Conclusion

The fetcher issues have been identified and fixed locally. The production environment needs to be updated with the latest code changes to resolve the continuous fetcher crashes. Once deployed, the bot should have full functionality with working game data fetching.
