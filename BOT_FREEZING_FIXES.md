# Bot Freezing Fixes

## Problem
The bot was freezing during startup after loading environment variables and Redis configuration. The issue was occurring during the database connection and Redis connection attempts.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Redis Connection Hanging**: The Redis connection was timing out or hanging during the `cache_manager.connect()` call
2. **Database Connection Hanging**: The MySQL connection pool creation was potentially hanging
3. **No Timeout Protection**: The startup process had no timeout protection, causing indefinite hangs

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Disabled Redis Temporarily
- Added `REDIS_DISABLED=true` environment variable in `main.py`
- This prevents the Redis connection attempt that was causing the freeze
- The bot can function without Redis cache (will use local fallback)

### 2. Added Database Connection Timeout
- Modified `db_manager.py` to add a 30-second timeout around the entire database connection process
- Split the connection logic into `_create_pool_with_retries()` method
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 3. Added Bot Startup Timeout
- Modified `main.py` to add a 120-second timeout around the entire bot startup process
- Added timeout wrapper around `setup_hook()` with 60-second timeout
- Added detailed step-by-step logging to identify where freezes occur

### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed step-by-step logging in `_setup_hook_internal()`
- Each major initialization step is now logged with timestamps
- This helps identify exactly where the bot is freezing

## Files Modified

### `bot/main.py`
- Added Redis disable fix
- Added timeout wrapper around `setup_hook()`
- Added timeout wrapper around bot startup
- Added detailed logging for each startup step

### `bot/data/db_manager.py`
- Added timeout wrapper around database connection
- Split connection logic into separate method
- Added better error handling

### `test_bot_startup.py` (new)
- Created test script to verify fixes work
- Includes timeout protection for testing

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   python test_bot_startup.py
   ```

2. **Check the logs** for detailed step-by-step progress:
   - Step 1: One-time downloads
   - Step 2: Database connection
   - Step 3: Database schema initialization
   - Step 4: Extension loading
   - Step 5: Service initialization (a-h sub-steps)
   - Step 6: Webapp and fetcher startup

## Expected Behavior

With these fixes, the bot should:
1. Start up within 2 minutes (120-second timeout)
2. Show detailed logging of each step
3. Continue functioning even if Redis is unavailable
4. Provide clear error messages if any step fails

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor the bot** after deployment to ensure it starts successfully
2. **Check logs** to see which step was causing the freeze
3. **Re-enable Redis** once the connection issues are resolved
4. **Adjust timeouts** if needed based on actual startup times

## Redis Re-enabling

To re-enable Redis once the connection issues are resolved:
1. Remove the `REDIS_DISABLED=true` line from `main.py`
2. Verify Redis connection parameters in environment variables
3. Test the connection manually before re-enabling

## Emergency Fallback

If the bot still freezes, you can:
1. Set `REDIS_DISABLED=true` in your environment variables
2. Increase the timeout values in the code
3. Disable specific services that might be causing issues
