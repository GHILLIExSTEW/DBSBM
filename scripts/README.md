# Scripts Directory

This folder contains utility and automation scripts for the project. Each script is documented with its purpose and usage instructions in the script's header comments.

- Place all Python, Bash, or other automation scripts here.
- Scripts should be named descriptively (e.g., `start_services.py`, `create_database.py`).
- For each script, include a docstring or header comment explaining its function.
