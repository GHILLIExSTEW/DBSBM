API-FOOTBALL(3.9.3)
support:https://dashboard.api-football.comURL: https://www.api-football.com
Introduction
Welcome to Api-Football! You can use our API to access all API endpoints, which can get information
about Football Leagues & Cups.
We have language bindings in C, C#, cURL, Dart, Go, Java, Javascript, NodeJs, Objective-c, OCaml, Php,
PowerShell, Python, Ruby, Shell and Swift! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and
you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
The update frequency indicated in the documentation is given as an indication and may vary for certain
competitions.
Authentication
We uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new API key in our dashboard.
The accounts on RapidAPI and on our Dashboard are dissociated. Each of these registration methods has
its own URL and API-KEY. You must therefore adapt your scripts according to your subscription by
adapting the URL and your API-KEY.
RAPIDAPI : https://api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com/v3/
API-SPORTS : https://v3.football.api-sports.io/
Our API expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like
the following:
Make sure to replace XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx  with your API key.
REQUESTS HEADERS & CORS|7/20/25, 9:20 PM API-Football - Documentation
https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3 1/140

--- Page 2 ---
The API is configured to work only with GET requests and allows only the headers listed below:
x-rapidapi-host
x-rapidapi-key
x-apisports-key
If you make non-GET requests or add headers that are not in the list, you will receive an error from the API.
Some frameworks (especially in JS, nodeJS..) automatically add extra headers, you have to make sure to
remove them in order to get a response from the API.
API-SPORTS Account
If you decided to subscribe directly on our site, you have a dashboard at your disposal at the following url:
dashboard
It allows you to:
To follow your consumption in real time
Manage your subscription and change it if necessary
Check the status of our servers
Test all endpoints without writing a line of code.
You can also consult all this information directly through the API by calling the endpoint status.
This call does not count against the daily quota.

Headers sent as response
When consuming our API, you will always receive the following headers appended to the response:
x-ratelimit-requests-limit : The number of requests allocated per day according to your
subscription.
x-ratelimit-requests-remaining : The number of remaining requests per day according to your
subscription.
X-RateLimit-Limit : Maximum number of API calls per minute.
X-RateLimit-Remaining : Number of API calls remaining before reaching the limit per minute.

RAPIDAPI Account
All information related to your subscription are available on the rapidApi developer dashboard.7/20/25, 9:21 PM API-Football - Documentation
https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3 4/140

--- Page 5 ---
The RapidAPI developer dashboard is where you can see all of your apps, locate API keys, view analytics,
and manage billing settings.
To access the dashboard, simply login to RapidAPI and select 'My Apps' in the top-right menu.
Alternatively, you can head directly to https://rapidapi.com/developer/dashboard.
In the main dashboard, you will see account-wide analytics and account information. To get more detailed
information, you can select tabs on the left-hand side of the screen.
App Specific Analytics
Using the RapidAPI dashboard, you can also view analytics specific to each app in your account. To do so,
switch over to the 'Analytics' tab of your application in the dashboard.
On the top of the page, you'll be able to see a chart with all the calls being made to all the APIs your app is
connected to. You'll also be able to see a log with all the request data. You are also able to filter these
analytics to only show certain APIs within the app.
In each graph, you can view the following metrics:
API Calls : how many requests are being made
Error rates : how many requests are error some
Latency : how long (on average) requests take to execute
You may change the time period you're looking at by clicking the calendar icon and choosing a time range.
Headers sent as response
When consuming our API, you will always receive the following headers appended to the response:
server: The current version of the API proxy used by RapidAPI.
x-ratelimit-requests-limit : The number of requests the plan you are currently subscribed to
allows you to make, before incurring overages.
x-ratelimit-requests-remaining : The number of requests remaining before you reach the limit
of requests your application is allowed to make, before experiencing overage charges.
X-RapidAPI-Proxy-Response : This header is set to true when the RapidAPI proxy generates the
response, (i.e. the response is not generated from our servers)

Logos / Images
Calls to logos/images do not count towards your daily quota and are provided for free. However these
calls are subject to a rate per second & minute, it is recommended to save this data on your side in order
not to slow down or impact the user experience of your application or website. For this you can use CDNs
such as bunny.net.
We have a tutorial available here, which explains how to set up your own media system with BunnyCDN.
Logos, images and trademarks delivered through the API are provided solely for identification and
descriptive purposes (e.g., identifying leagues, teams, players or venues). We does not own any of these
visual assets, and no intellectual property rights are claimed over them. Some images or data may be
subject to intellectual property or trademark rights held by third parties (including but not limited to
leagues, federations, or clubs). The use of such content in your applications, websites, or products may
require additional authorization or licensing from the respective rights holders. You are fully responsible
for ensuring that your usage of any logos, images, or branded content complies with applicable laws in
your country or the countries where your services are made available. We are not affiliated with, sponsored
by, or endorsed by any sports league, federation, or brand featured in the data provided.
Sample Scripts
Here are some examples of how the API is used in the main development languages.7/20/25, 9:21 PM API-Football - Documentation
https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3 6/140

--- Page 7 ---
 You have to replace {endpoint}  by the real name of the endpoint you want to call, like leagues  or
fixtures  for example. In all the sample scripts we will use the leagues  endpoint as example.
Also you will have to replace XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx  with your API-KEY provided in the dashboard or
on rapidapi.

Widgets
Our widgets are completely free and work with all our plans including the free plan.
To integrate the widgets to your site you just have to copy/paste  the code provided and fill in the tags
needed for the widget to work properly. If you integrate several widgets on the same page a single theme
will be applied for all widgets. Also you will only have to integrate the script tag once.
For all widgets the following tags are needed :
data-host  : v3.football.api-sports.io or api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com depending on whether you have
subscribed with us or RapidApi.
data-key  : Indicate your API-KEY obtained on our Dashboard or on RapidApi.
data-theme  : If you leave the field empty, the default theme will be applied, otherwise the possible
values are grey or dark. It is also possible to indicate false which will not display any theme and lets you
customize the widget with your own css.7/20/25, 9:21 PM API-Football - Documentation
https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3 24/140

--- Page 25 ---
data-show-errors  : By default false, used for debugging, with a value of true it allows to display the
errors.
Widgets use the requests associated with your account and therefore they will stop working if your daily
limit is reached. You can track all requests made directly in the dashboard.
Security :
When using these widgets it is important to be aware that your API-KEY will be visible to the users of your
site, it is possible to protect yourself from this by allowing only the desired domains in our dashboard. This
way no one else can use your API-KEY for you. If you have already set up your widget and have not
activated this option, you can reset your API-KEY and activate this option after.
Debugging :
If the widget does not display the requested information, it is possible to set the data-show-errors  tag
to true to display error messages directly in the widget and in the console. This can be due to several
things like : (Non-exhaustive list)
You have reached your daily number of requests
Tags are incorrectly filled in
Your API-KEY is incorrect

Leagues
Get the list of available leagues and cups.
The league id are unique in the API and leagues keep it across all seasons
To get the logo of a competition you have to call the following url:
https://media.api-
sports.io/football/leagues/{league_id}.webp
This endpoint also returns the coverage  of each competition, which makes it possible to know what is
available for that league or cup.
The values returned by the coverage indicate the data available at the moment you call the API, so for a
competition that has not yet started, it is normal to have all the features set to False. This will be
updated once the competition has started.
You can find all the leagues ids on our Dashboard.
Example :
"coverage"
  "fixtures"
      "events"  true
      "lineups"  true
      "statistics_fixtures"  false
      "statistics_players"  false

  "standings"  true
  "players"  true
  "top_scorers"  true
  "top_assists"  true
  "top_cards"  true
  "injuries"  true
  "predictions"  true
  "odds" false
In this example we can deduce that the competition does not have the following features:
statistics_fixtures , statistics_players , odds because it is set to False.
The coverage of a competition can vary from season to season and values set to True do not guarantee
100% data availability.
Some competitions, such as the friendlies , are exceptions to the coverage indicated in the leagues
endpoint, and the data available may differ depending on the match, including livescore, events, lineups,
statistics and players.
Competitions are automatically renewed by the API when a new season is available. There may be a delay
between the announcement of the official calendar and the availability of data in the API.

AWDTechnical LossNot Played
WO WalkOver Not PlayedVictory by forfeit or absence of competitor
LIVEIn Progress In PlayUsed in very rare cases. It indicates a fixture in
progress but the data indicating the half-time or
elapsed time are not available
Fixtures with the status TBD may indicate an incorrect fixture date or time because the fixture date or
time is not yet known or final. Fixtures with this status are checked and updated daily. The same applies to
fixtures with the status PST, CANC.
The fixtures ids are unique and specific to each fixture. In no case an ID will change.
Not all competitions have livescore available and only have final result . In this case, the status
remains in NS and will be updated in the minutes/hours following the match (this can take up to 48
hours, depending on the competition).
Although the data is updated every 15 seconds, depending on the competition there may be a delay
between reality and the availability of data in the API.
Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated every 15 seconds.
Recommended Calls : 1 call per minute for the leagues, teams, fixtures who have at least one fixture in
progress otherwise 1 call per day.
Here are several examples of what can be achieved

 This endpoint returns in-play odds for fixtures in progress.
Fixtures are added between 15 and 5 minutes before the start of the fixture. Once the fixture is over they
are removed from the endpoint between 5 and 20 minutes. No history is stored. So fixtures that are about
to start, fixtures in progress and fixtures that have just ended are available in this endpoint.
Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated every 5 seconds.*
* This value can change in the range of 5 to 60 seconds
INFORMATIONS ABOUT STATUS
"status"
    "stopped"  false // True if the fixture is stopped by the referee for X reaso
    "blocked"  false // True if bets on this fixture are temporarily blocked
    "finished"  false // True if the fixture has not started or if it is finished
INFORMATIONS ABOUT VALUES
When several identical values exist for the same bet the main field is set to True for the bet being
considered, the others will have the value False.
The main field will be set to True only if several identical values exist for the same bet.
When a value is unique for a bet the main value will always be False or null.
Example below :
"id" 36
"name" "Over/Under Line"
"values"

        "value"  "Over"
        "odd" "1.975"
        "handicap"  "2"
        "main" true // Bet to consider
        "suspended"  false // True if this bet is temporarily suspended


        "value"  "Over"
        "odd" "3.45"
        "handicap"  "2"
        "main" false // Bet to no consider
        "suspended"  false
